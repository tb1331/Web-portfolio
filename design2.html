                <h2>What is cyber security</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity is a field dedicated to safeguarding computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. Its primary objectives include ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Common threats, such as malware, phishing, and denial of service attacks, necessitate the implementation of security measures like firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. Security awareness and incident response plans are vital components, as human error and the inevitability of incidents require proactive approaches. Compliance with industry regulations, the adaptation to emerging technologies, and global collaboration are integral aspects of a robust cybersecurity strategy. The field offers diverse career paths and requires continuous learning to stay ahead of evolving threats and technologies. Ultimately, cybersecurity is essential in our interconnected digital age to mitigate risks and maintain the trust and functionality of digital systems. </p>

                <h2>How to enter?</h2>
                <p>Embarking on a career in cybersecurity involves a multifaceted approach, starting with a solid educational foundation. A degree in computer science, information technology, or a related field is beneficial, but self-learning and practical experience are equally important. Acquiring foundational knowledge in networking, operating systems, and programming languages like Python lays the groundwork. Industry-recognized certifications, such as CompTIA Security+, CISSP, CEH, or OSCP, provide validation of skills. Hands-on experience through internships, entry-level positions, or personal projects is crucial for developing practical skills. Specializing in a specific area of cybersecurity, networking within the cybersecurity community, and attending conferences enhance one's understanding of the field. Continuous learning is vital in this dynamic environment, and staying updated on the latest trends and threats is essential. Building a portfolio that showcases projects, certifications, and experience becomes a powerful tool for job applications. Entry-level positions, like security analyst or system administrator, provide valuable on-the-job experience. Engaging in Capture The Flag challenges and competitions adds a practical, problem-solving dimension to your skill set. Developing soft skills, including communication and collaboration, is key as cybersecurity professionals often work with diverse teams and communicate with non-technical stakeholders. As you gain experience, you may choose to pursue further education or certifications aligned with your career goals. Ultimately, persistence, curiosity, and adaptability are essential attributes for success in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. </p>
